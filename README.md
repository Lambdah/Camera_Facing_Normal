# Camera Facing Normal (Blender 4.5 Addon)

This Blender 4.5 addon renders **normal maps** and **opacity maps** from the camera’s perspective.  
Rendering objects to images is useful for background or stationary objects because it reduces draw calls. Pairing the rendered image with a normal map can add depth and surface detail without needing a full 3D mesh.  

The workflow is based on this YouTube video:

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Set up your object and camera in 3D space.  
2. Switch the camera to **Orthographic** mode — otherwise, a gradient will appear in the normal render.  
3. Open the **Camera Facing Normal** panel in the **3D Viewport sidebar** (N-panel).  
4. Use the buttons provided:  
   - **Render Normal** — exports a camera-facing normal map image.  
   - **Render Opacity** — exports the opacity (alpha) map image.
